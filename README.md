# Multi-Criteria Decision Making via Bayesian Learning 


This repository has the code base for the _Interactive Multi-Criteria Decision Making through Bayesian Learning of Hidden Preferences_ framework. Currently, this repository has the algorithm implementation for Tanaka's test multi-objective optimization problem. Additional examples will be added later.  

Please look at the directory R for the source code.
